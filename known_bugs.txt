known bugs in minishell:

1. cat Makefile || << end cat ; this should print a warning about the 2 pipes
2. exit status changes in the parent process

Dardan:
	Test cd error message at school!

notes:
	1. exiting heredoc with SIGINT leaves the process open until minishell is exited
	this doesn't happen with EOF or normally exiting with the delimiter

	2. running a command that is not found -> memory leaks

	3. PWD env variable is not restored after unsetting it. tried using cd and PWD
	neither worked
		- also this resulted in OLDPWD being empty (probably after cd)

	4. echo "123'rrr" -> open quotes error, should print: 123'rrr

	5. export PATH=$PWD/exe -> path is now empty
		- export PATH=/home/jhesso/dev/minishell/exe -> this sets it correctly
