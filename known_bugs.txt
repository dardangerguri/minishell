known bugs in minishell:

1. signals not working properly when in heredoc
2. < file | < input If either of these files exist the error massage ||| I FIXED THIS BUT WILL BE GOOD TO BE TESTED!!!
	for both is only the first file!
	minishell: file: No such file or directory
	minishell: file: No such file or directory
3. cat | cat | ls



Dardan:
	Check the expansion again! echo $random $USER should not give space in between...
	if home is unset, "cd" should complain!!
