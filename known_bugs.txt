known bugs in minishell:

1. fd leaks when running builtin commands
2. we actually get fd leaks with every command
	- I can fix it for other than builtins but that
		breaks piping =.=
3. signals not working properly when in heredoc
4. cat does not work when no file specified
	- this is most likely a problem with piping or somethign
