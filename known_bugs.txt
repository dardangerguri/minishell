known bugs in minishell:


notes:
	1. exiting heredoc with SIGINT leaves the process open until minishell is exited
	this doesn't happen with EOF or normally exiting with the delimiter

	2. if you run two minishells simultaneously and open heredocs in both, on of them freezes when trying to exit!

	3. if you open heredoc in a directory that doesnt exist, it freezes!
	Example: mkdir a
	cd a
	mkdir b
	cd b
	rm -rf ../../a
	<< end

	2. when you ctrlc the error code should be 1!
