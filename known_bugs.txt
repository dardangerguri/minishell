known bugs in minishell:

1. signals not working properly when in heredoc
2. cat does not work when no file specified
	- this is most likely a problem with piping or somethign
3. echo hello | pwd | ls -la | wc -w
	- number of words printed is 0 (should not be like this)
4. STDIN is fucked somehow and thats why running ./minishell exits the minishell immediately
	propably the same reason cat doesn't want to work too well






Dardan:
	Check the expansion again! echo $random $USER should not give space in between...
	if home is unset, "cd" should complain!!
