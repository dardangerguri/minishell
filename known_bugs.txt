known bugs in minishell:

needs to be tested at school:
	1. exit hello
		- minishell: exit code: 255
		- bash 2
	2. cd $PWD hi
		- minishell: (no error msg) exit code: 0
		- bash: "-bash: cd: too many arguments" exit code: 1
	3. echo "$   a"
		- minishell: infinite loop (same as we had with "$" im guessing)
