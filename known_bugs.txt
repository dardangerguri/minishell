known bugs in minishell:

1. signals not working properly when in heredoc
2. < file | < input If either of these files exist the error massage ||| I FIXED THIS BUT WILL BE GOOD TO BE TESTED!!!
	for both is only the first file!
	minishell: file: No such file or directory
	minishell: file: No such file or directory
3. cat | cat | ls  Since there are two 'cat' commands this should request a new command line after two enter! Our thing is going infinitely!
4. 	mkdir a
	cd a
	mkdir b
	cd b
	rm -r ../../a
	This is not crashing but is blocking everything! Check how bash works!

Dardan:
	Check the expansion again! echo $random $USER should not give space in between...
	if home is unset, "cd" should complain!!
